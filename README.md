-  Hi, I’m @Pokedevon
-  I’m interested in a bunch of things, including playing music and programming.
-  I’m currently learning how tedious spriting can be. But I'm also learning how to make a program feel polished.
-  I don't have any immediate interest in collaboration, and I probably won't bring a ton of help to your projects right now.
-  If you still REALLY want to collaborate with me, you can try tagging me in a comment to get my attention.
-  Fun fact: While it's nowhere near the best out there, I can beat Super Mario 64 in under half an hour.
